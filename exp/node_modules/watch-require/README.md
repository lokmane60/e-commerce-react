This is a small library which requires any NodeJS script and watches for
changes. If changes are detected, an event is emitted and the exports object is
updated.

```js
const watchRequire = require('watch-require')
const util = require('util')

const watched = watchRequire(path.resolve('index.js'))

function dumpExports(exports) {
  console.log(util.inspect(exports))
}

watched.on('change', dumpExports)

dumpExports(watched.exports)
```

## API

### watchRequire(modulePath)

Requires the module which is present on the module path.

### watched.exports 

Contains the `module.exports` of the script that is being watched.

### watched.on('change', cb)

Will run `cb` each time the script or one of its required files changed on
disk. The callback is called with a single argument which holds the new exports
of the script, as if a fresh `require()` had been done.

### watched.forceReload()

Forces a manual reload of the required script, updating the `exports` object.

This method will flush the cache for the current watcher. That is, other
wachters will remain attached to old versions of the script, while this script
and all of its dependencies will get updated.
